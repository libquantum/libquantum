libquantum 0.9.1 README file
----------------------------

libquantum is a C library for quantum computing and quantum
simulation. It provides quantum registers, unitary operations, time
evolution, and measurement functions. The main goal is a physically
precise simulation of a quantum system with high performance.

Implementations of Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search
algorithm are included with this release.
