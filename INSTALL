0. Requirements
---------------

libquantum needs a C compiler with complex number support (C99
prefered). A recent gcc (>=2.9.5) will do the job. Furthermore, the
host must support 64-bit integers, even if it is not a 64-bit machine.

If you encounter any difficulties while building, installing or using
libquantum, we would like to hear from you. Just send a mail to
libquantum@enyo.de.


1. Configure and Make
---------------------

As libquantum was created using autoconf and libtool, this step should
not be a major problem. Simply extract the tarball to a directory:

	tar xzvf libquantum-0.1.0.tar.gz

Next, run the configure script:

	./configure

Now you can build the beast:

	make

By now, you can create a sample program which implements Shor's
factoring algorithm:

	make shor

The number to be factored is given on the command line as the first
parameter. To factor 15, simply type:

	./shor 15


2. Installation of the library
------------------------------

For this step you will need to have superuser privileges. Just type

	make install

to get libquantum installed into the default directory, which is
usually /usr/local/bin. Note that on some systems this directories is
not in the standard search path. Take a look at the output of the last
command to get some advice on how to deal with this.

3. Writing your own programs
----------------------------

You can use libquantum as any other C library. Just #include
<quantum.h> in your source file and link the library into your program
with the linker flag -lquantum.
